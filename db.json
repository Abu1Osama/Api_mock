      "description": "Neurobion Forte Tablet is a popular vitamin supplement that enhances the functioning of the nervous system, metabolism, immune system, skin/hair health, red blood cell production, liver health, and other bodily functions. Neurobion Forte Tablet also addresses vitamin deficiencies and neuropathic pain.  \n\nNeurobion Forte Tablet contains calcium pantothenate, cyanocobalamin, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin, and thiamine mononitrate. Neurobion Forte Tablet prevents the tingling and numbness connected to neuropathic pain by supporting, repairing, and protecting injured nerve cells. \n\nThe Neurobion Forte Tablet is crucial for the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and amino acids, cell maturation, preservation of nerve fibres, production of neurotransmitters in the nervous system, and maintenance of the structure of nerve cells.    \n\nTake Neurobion Forte Tablet as advised by the doctor. Sometimes, you may experience typical side effects like stomach upset, constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Many side effects do not require immediate medical attention and will disappear gradually. However, you should consult your doctor if you experience these persistent side effects.\n\nNeurobion forte tablet Composition:\nVitamin B1 (Thiamine mononitrate): 10 mg\nVitamin B2 (Riboflavin): 10 mg\nVitamin B3 (Nicotinamide): 45 mg\nVitamin B5 (Calcium Pantothenate): 50 mg\nVitamin B6 (Pyridoxine hydrochloride): 3 mg\nVitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin): 15 mcg\n1. Thiamin (Vitamin B1)\n\nThiamin, known as Vitamin B1, is a coenzyme involved in several enzymatic reactions. Its deficiency can cause beriberi, headache, tiredness, anorexia, muscle wasting, weight loss, anorexia, short-term memory loss, and other mental symptoms. Patients with long-term thiamine deficiency may experience a lack of sensation in the hands and legs, heart failure signs like swelling in the hands or feet, sensations of vertigo, or other neurological problems. Thiamin deficiency can result in a central nervous system disorder known as Wernicke's encephalopathy, characterised by confusion, ataxia (disorders that affect coordination, balance and speech) and coma. The person who suffers from B1 deficiency has impaired sensory, motor, and reflex functions.\n\n2. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)\n\nRiboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin of the B group (vitamin B2). It is an essential ingredient of all living cells. This B vitamin is required for normal growth and to assist in synthesising steroids, red blood cells, and glycogen. It helps to maintain the integrity of mucous membranes, skin, eyes and the nervous system. It supports the activity of antioxidants and is involved in the production of adrenaline by the adrenal glands. It aids the body in absorbing iron. Its deficiency causes dry and cracked skin, sensitivity to bright light, itching, dizziness, insomnia, slow learning, weakness, sore throat, hyperaemia and oedema of the pharyngeal and oral mucous membranes, cheilosis(chapped lips), angular stomatitis, glossitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, corneal vascularisation and anaemia associated with pure red cell hypoplasia of the bone marrow.\n\n3. Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3)\n\nNicotinamide (also known as nicotinic acid amide/niacinamide), is a water-soluble vitamin. Nicotinic acid and its amide nicotinamide are the common forms of B-vitamin niacin (vitamin B3).

It works by breaking down the chemical structure of the mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Ambrodil S syrup should only be taken as prescribed by a healthcare professional and not be used as a substitute for proper medical treatment. \n\nIt is also essential to follow the prescribed physician's recommended dosage and age limit.\n\nAmbrodil S Syrup Composition\nAmbroxol Hydrochloride: Ambroxol is a mucolytic agent that helps thin and loosen the respiratory tract's mucus.

It works by breaking down the chemical structure of the mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.\nSalbutamol: It is a bronchodilator that helps widen the airways in the lungs, making breathing easier. Salbutamol is a type of beta-2 agonist, which means it stimulates the beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles around the airways to relax. This results in widening the airways and relieving symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Salbutamol is usually inhaled using a nebuliser, metered-dose inhaler or dry powder inhaler. It can also be given orally as tablets or syrup.",

Some of the Ambrodil S syrup uses are:\n\nAmbrodil S syrup is used to treat wet or productive cough and respiratory disorders with viscous mucus: Mucus is produced by the mucus membranes that line your mouth, nose, throat, sinuses, and lungs, and it interacts with the tiny hairs that cover your airways. The mucus collects particles like dust and protects the body from disease. However, thick or dense mucus can trigger your body's cough response, causing wet or chronic coughs. Ambrodil S syrup breaks down the acid mucopolysaccharide fibres, making the mucous (sputum) thinner and less dense/viscous, allowing coughing to remove sputum effectively. \nTreatment of Asthma Symptoms: Ambrodil S syrup may be part of a comprehensive treatment plan for asthma, a chronic respiratory condition that can cause coughing, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing.\nAlleviation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms: Ambrodil S syrup can relieve various respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing.",
